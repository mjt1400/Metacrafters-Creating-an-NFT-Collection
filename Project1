/*
Assessment Requirements
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of NFT's. What type of variable might this be?
2. Create an object inside your mintNFT function that will hold the metadata for your NFTs. 
   The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, 
   you will store it in the variable you created in step 1
3. Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name))
4. For good measure, getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFT's you have created
*/

// create a variable to hold your NFT's

// this function will take in some values as parameters, create an
// NFT object using the parameters passed to it for its metadata, 
// and store it in the variable above.


// Functionalities
// Has the ability to "mint" NFTs and store them
// You should "mint" at least three NFT's
// Has the ability to print the details of your NFTs to the console
// Has the ability to print the total supply of your NFT collection to the console

let NFTs = [];
let owner = "John";    // The owner variable is defined outside the function and is initially set to "John". The purpose of the "owner" property is to keep track of who owns the NFT. 
let totalMinted = 0; // This is the variable that holds the number of NFTs minted. This variable is initially set to 0 and is incremented by 1 every time a new NFT is minted using the mintNFT function.
